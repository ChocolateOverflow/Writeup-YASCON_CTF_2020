The musical prodigy Bethovan has influenced me a lot on my passion for music. As the part of my musical journey, I tried composing songs. But I was depressed over the fact that those were not upto my satisfaction. This particular music note is what i call the masterpiece of my creation. Can you read this! ?

It's been a while since I last read a music sheet but this isn't too hard to read.
