# Meeseeks and Destroy

250 points (Medium)
Yesterday, I was doing some finishing works for my upcoming project in my system. But while I was halfway through my work, my system got crashed suddenly. I don't know what was the cause of it and I dont quite understand these things. Although I have done a memory dump, I don't really know what else to do. Can you help me fix this?
